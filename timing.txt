00:00-00:08 1   And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of aseeds of every kind, both of grain of every kind, and also of
                the seeds of fruit of every kind.
00:08-00:16 2   And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I have adreamed a dream;
                or, in other words, I have bseen a vision.
00:16-00:26 3   And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have reason to rejoice in the Lord because of aNephi and also of Sam;
                for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their seed, will be saved.

<<<< hit play here >>>>

00:26-00:34 4   But behold, aLaman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of you; for behold, methought I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary wilderness.

[above table, see lehi and man in white, zooming in]
00:34-00:39 5   And it came to pass that I saw a aman, and he was dressed in a white brobe; and he came and stood before me.

[from side of both, man in white points and signals to follow]
00:39-00:42 6   And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow him.

[above table, both "walking" but stay in place while scenery slides by]
00:42-00:47 7   And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste.
00:47-00:56 8   And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have amercy on me,
                according to the multitude of his tender mercies.

LehiGetsFruit: 70 sec total
- 9s, v9-10: fade in, field, pan up to tree
- 26s, v11-12: lehi at tree, reaches out, panning closeup of fruit in Lehi's hand
- 22s, v13-14: look at lehi turning, then look from lehi panning to river of water, look further downriver to sariah, sam, nephi
- 9s, v15: lehi with hands up, calling to them
- 4s, v16: them at tree, getting the fruit, then fade to black

[close up of lehi as light comes up with green background]
00:56-01:00 9   And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld a large and spacious afield.

[over lehi's shoulder, pan up to see field, then tree, with white fruit]
01:00-01:05 10  And it came to pass that I beheld a atree, whose bfruit was desirable to make one chappy.

[above tree, looking at lehi, as he walks towards tree]
[closeup of lehi's arm getting fruit]
[back to lehi, "eating" the fruit, happy]
01:05-01:18 11  And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the afruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that
                I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the bwhiteness that I had ever seen.
01:18-01:31 12  And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great ajoy; wherefore, I began to be bdesirous that my family
                should partake of it also; for I knew that it was cdesirable above all other fruit.

[lehi looks around]
[from lehi's perspective, panning]
01:31-01:41 13  And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover my family also, I beheld a ariver of water; and it ran along, and it
                was near the tree of which I was partaking the fruit.

[pan to river alongside tree, to head of stream, to sariah, sam, nephi who are turning to figure out where to go]
01:41-01:53 14  And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the head thereof a little way off; and at the head thereof I beheld your mother
                Sariah, and Sam, and aNephi; and they stood as if they knew not whither they should go.

[from their view to Lehi, him waving]
01:53-02:03 15  And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me, and
                partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other fruit.

[them walking to lehi]
[them at tree, taking fruit]
02:03-02:06 16  And it came to pass that they did come unto me and partake of the fruit also.

[78 sec for path + rod]

[looking at lehi, again looking around]
17  And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine eyes
    towards the head of the river, that perhaps I might see them.

[from lehi's view, panning to laman and lemuel (back to same spot as sariah & sons were)]
[laman and lemuel turning away and moving off]
18  And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would anot come unto me and partake of the fruit.

[pan to iron rod alongside river]
[shot of iron rod ending near tree]
19  And I beheld a arod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.

[back to iron rod at head of river, now panning the other way to a field]
20  And I also beheld a astrait and narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it also led
    by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious field, as if it had been a bworld.

[back to start of path, with a line of people getting to it]
21  And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were apressing forward, that they might obtain the bpath which led unto the tree
    by which I stood.
22  And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the path which led to the tree.

[overhead shot of mists moving in, people going down wrong paths]
[back to start of path, with a person getting onto it]
23  And it came to pass that there arose a amist of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had
    commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were blost.

[close up of person feeling around blindly, then touching the rod and then clinging with both hands]
[at the tree, emerging from the mists and getting the fruit]
24  And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did
    press forward through the mist of darkness, aclinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree.

03:09-03:14 25  And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were aashamed.

03:14-03:22 26  And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the aother side of the river of water, a great and bspacious building; and it stood as
                it were in the cair, high above the earth.

03:22-03:33 27  And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in
                the aattitude of bmocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.

03:33-03:40 28  And after they had atasted of the fruit they were bashamed, because of those that were cscoffing at them; and they dfell away into
                forbidden paths and were lost.



03:40-03:42 29  And now I, Nephi, do not speak aall the words of my father.

03:42-03:56 30  But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the arod of
                iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook
                of the fruit of the tree.
03:56-04:01 31  And he also saw other amultitudes feeling their way towards that great and spacious building.
04:01-04:07 32  And it came to pass that many were drowned in the adepths of the bfountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in strange roads.

04:07-04:18 33  And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And after they did enter into that building they did point the finger
                of ascorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 3:49

[fade to black]
04:18-04:22 34  These are the words of my father: For as many as aheeded them, had fallen away.
04:22-04:25 35  And aLaman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, said my father.
04:25-04:40 36  And it came to pass after my father had spoken all the words of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because of these
                things which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off from the presence
                of the Lord.
04:40-04:51 37  And he did aexhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord would be
                merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my father did preach unto them.
04:51-04:59 38  And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto them of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord; and
                he did cease speaking unto them.
